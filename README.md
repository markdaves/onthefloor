# onthefloor

A repo for my modest collection of small Debianscripts. Nothing fancy, just trying to streamline some tasks within Debian (Kali)


bootnw
A small script that randomizes the mac-address of 2 networkcards (wlan0,wlan1)

boottx
Increases the txpower from my networkcard (which i put in monitormode behorehand, wlan1mon). Increases tx to the max.

bootint
Script that randomizes macs and puts wlan0 into monitor mode (comes in handy if you only want to use wlan1 as an internetconnection. For some reason you can't always ifdown wlan0 without putting down wlan1 as well).
